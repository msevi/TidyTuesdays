- The ultimate objective for our research is to generate and disseminate *usable* knowledge.

- In this iterative process, ideally, we would like our projects to have one or more of the following characteristics:

# The aim: [Reproducible research](https://nbisweden.github.io/RaukR-2019/rr/presentation/rr_presentation.html#1)


- The ultimate objective for our research is to generate and disseminate *usable* knowledge.   


- In this iterative process, ideally, we would like our projects to have one or more of the following characteristics:  

.pull-right[
- Ability to rerun **workflows**  
- Incorporate feedback and make changes [Additional data/New data]  
- Return to a project  
- Hand off projects  
- Collaborate with others

# Workflow

--
- Put simply, a workflow allows us to perform **predictable** and **repetitive** tasks.  

--

- It consists of  multiple steps that take raw data or previous outputs as input, execute a set of instructions and outputs something.

--

- Generally, we want to:   
  - Manage data (wrangle, input)  
  - Do an analysis  
  - Make tables and plots  
  - Integrate the tables and graphs into a manuscript

# The means: workflow managers

There are several tools to do this:  
- Snakemake  

- Nexflow  

- Drake

# Snakemake

- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is "a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses". It allows for **automation** of commands in a single script and **scalability** for reproducible data analyses handling *parallelization* all while being *portable*.  

- It was created by [Koesters et al](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/28/19/2520/290322) in 2012.  

- The three essential elements of a SNAKEMAKE workflow are:  

(1) Inputs: user defined/provided or outputs  
(2) Rules/steps/jobs: workflow definitions that use inputs and return outputs  
(3) Output: target that does not exist

- DAG is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of jobs where the edges represent dependencies.  

- Take a look at this useful [example workflow](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/basics.html) and [these](https://slides.com/johanneskoester/snakemake-tutorial#/) complimentary slides. ]
