title: "TidyTuesday"

Some [Pinto lab](https://www.pintolab.com/) members, under [Chris Anderson](https://github.com/chrisLanderson) lead, meet every Tuesday to discuss visualization and analyses of [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data.  

As a group exercise the objectives are:  

* gain proficiency with R:  
    + learn about new packages
    + improve code readability
    + improve visualization techniques  
* learn from each other  
* do (some) research outside our own and have fun!

In this repo I will be documenting *my* contribution. In most folders, there will be an md file. If you'd like to have a human readable document click on this file, else you can download the Rmarkdown also within the folders and run the commands in your local computer.  

Disclaimer: Time spent on TidyTuesdays is limited to 3-5 hrs a week. The analyses/visualizations might not be the most sophisticated, but a lot of learning is happening! :)  

Please exercise caution and your own judgement if using any of the info herein. Also note, that some of the renderings are not faithfully reproduced when exported to a markdown file. 

So far I have looked at data about:

1. Australian fires  
2. Passwords  
3. Spotify  
4. San Francisco trees  
5. NFL attendance  
6. Hotels  
7. Measles  
8. NHL  
9. College tuition  
10. The Office  
11. Brain injuries  
12. Beer  
13. Tour de France


13 out of 14, what a streak!

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(flexdashboard)
gauge(13, min = 0, max = 48, gaugeSectors(
  success = c(80, 100), warning = c(40, 79), danger = c(0, 39)
), label = 'Projects')
```
